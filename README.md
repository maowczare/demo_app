This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Unesco Demo App

In this project I wanted to show how to create a modern web app frontend using latest web technologies.
Application fetches data from the Unesco API and displays it in a nice way with some basic features like filtering and pagination.
Since I wanted to focus more on the frontend side and because of the time limitation I decided not create local API instance but a NodeJS script that fetches XML data from the web and converts it to the json format that is loaded by NextJS app.
Data can be easily synced to the newest data by running `npm run data-sync`.

Frontend technologies used:
- NextJS (https://nextjs.org/) - as a framework for building the app that offers flexible SSR and other out-of-the-box solutions
- shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/) - for UI components without external library dependencies
- Tailwind CSS - for styling

Most important files:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - main page component - that loads data and renders main layout component
- `src/components/CardLayout` - main component that generates data layout
- `src/components/ui` - components automatically generated by shadcn/ui
- `src/lib/data.ts` - data fetching and processing
- `data_sync.js` - node script that fetches data from Unesco API and converts it to json format

How to run:

```bash
#install dependencies
npm install
#optional - run data sync script
npm run data-sync
#run app in dev mode
npm run dev
```
